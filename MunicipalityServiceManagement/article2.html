        <h6 class="news-source" id="news-source">Beirut.com - Hamra 1973</h6>
        <p class="news-desc" id="news-desc">Beirut, Lebanon – A newly rediscovered photograph from 1973 offers a vibrant
            look at Hamra Street during its heyday.
            Once the beating heart of Beirut, the image captures the street bustling with life, lined with cars of the
            era and
            framed by its signature blend of modernist architecture and thriving businesses.

            In the 1970s, Hamra was a cultural and commercial hub, home to theaters, cafés, and shops that drew locals
            and tourists
            alike. It symbolized a cosmopolitan Beirut, renowned as the “Paris of the Middle East.”

            This historic snapshot not only evokes nostalgia but also serves as a reminder of the city’s resilience and
            enduring
            spirit, even as it has transformed over the decades.
