        <p class="news-desc" id="news-desc">In 1948â€“49 the AJCW program was expanded under the name Beirut College for
            Women (BCW). In 1950, it was granted a
            provisional charter by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York and it was authorized
            to bestow
            four-year Bachelor of Arts degrees and two-year associate degrees. In 1955 the Board of Regents granted BCW
            an absolute
            charter with all its rights and privileges, including the authority to also hand out Bachelor of Science
            degrees.</p>
